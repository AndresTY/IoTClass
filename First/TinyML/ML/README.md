# TinyML

Simple example of how to use machine learning models in embedded systems. In this case, TinyML is a tool designed to optimize, compile, reduce and allow its use in low power systems.

The objective of TinyML is to bring machine learning to the edge in an extreme way, where battery-powered, microcontroller-based embedded devices can perform ML tasks with real-time responsivity. This effort is extraordinarily multidisciplinary, requiring optimization and maximization from fields including hardware, software, data science, and machine learning.
